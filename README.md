## About

This work develops a foundational account of alignment grounded in
irreversible commitment. Alignment is treated not as conformity to
externally imposed objectives, but as an intrinsic constraint arising
from the coherence of forward-binding commitments under irreversible
time.

Deceptive or incoherent configurations are shown to collapse as
irreversible commitments accumulate, constraining long-term persistence
to trajectories that preserve commitment coherence.
